GNU Guix for High-Performance Computing
===========================================

[![pipeline status](https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr/jobset/guix-hpc/badge.svg)](https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr/jobset/guix-hpc) [![SWH](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/badge/origin/https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc/)](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc/)

Hello!  This repository contains package recipes and extensions of the
[GNU Guix package manager](https://gnu.org/s/guix) for high-performance
computing (HPC).  Notably, it contains packages for HPC software
developed at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en).

The goal is for most contributions to go upstream.  This repo acts as a
staging area or a place to store things not meant for public consumption
yet.

Please send inquiries to the [Guix-Science mailing
list](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/guix-science) or to
[Ludovic Courtès](mailto:ludovic.courtes@inria.fr).

## Getting started

All of this won’t be of any use to you until you have
[Guix](https://gnu.org/s/guix) on your system.  See the
[installation instructions here](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Binary-Installation.html).

If you’d like to use Guix on a cluster that doesn’t have it yet, stay
tuned: we’re working on ways to make it usable without the `root`
privileges that the
[build daemon currently requires](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Build-Environment-Setup.html).

## How does it work?

The package definitions in this repo _extend_ [those that come with
Guix](https://gnu.org/s/guix/packages).  To make them visible to the
`guix` command-line tools, create the `~/.config/guix/channels.scm` file
with the following snippet to request the `guix-hpc` _channel_:

```scheme
(cons (channel
        (name 'guix-hpc)
        (url "https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc.git"))
      %default-channels)
```

That way, `guix pull` will systematically pull not only Guix, but also
Guix-HPC.

## Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries for Guix-HPC packages are served from
`https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr`. To benefit from them, you must (1) add this
repository to the list of substitute-urls and (2) authorize the key associated
with this repository.  [As the manual
explains](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Getting-Substitutes-from-Other-Servers.html),
it goes along these lines:

  1. Add `https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr` to the `--substitute-urls`
     option [of
     `guix-daemon`](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix_002ddaemon.html#daemon_002dsubstitute_002durls)
     or that [of client
     tools](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Common-Build-Options.html#client_002dsubstitute_002durls).
     
     To enable it globally, you must modify the guix-daemon. How to do that
     depends how your services are handled on the system. If you are running
     guix on top of a foreign distribution (such as Debian, Ubuntu, ...), your
     system is likely to rely on systemd to handle services. In this case, you
     may enable the guix-daemon as follows and proceed to (2):
	 
	 ```
	 $EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service

	   … add ‘--substitute-urls='https://ci.guix.gnu.org https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr'’
       to the ‘guix-daemon’ command line.
	  
     systemctl daemon-reload
	 systemctl restart guix-daemon.service
	 ```
     
     On Guix System itself, services are handled by the Shepherd.  You can for
     instance declare a customized list of services `%my-service` (here derived
     from `%desktop-services` but you may want to derive it from `%base-services` on
     a server-only system) in your `/etc/config.scm` configuration file:
     
     ```scheme
     (define %my-services
	   (modify-services %desktop-services
		 (guix-service-type config =>
		  (guix-configuration
		   (inherit config)
		   (substitute-urls '("https://ci.guix.gnu.org"
                              "https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr"))))))
     ```

     These customized services can then be used in the declaration of your
     operating system further in the same /etc/config.scm configuration file:
     
     ```scheme
     (operating-system
      ;; ...
      (services %my-services)
      ;; ...
     )
     ```
     
     In practice, instead of declaring your services with this customized list
     only, you will likely append typical additional services you use to it,
     such as in the following example:
     
     ```scheme
     (services
      (append
      (list (service gnome-desktop-service-type)
	        (service openssh-service-type)
            (set-xorg-configuration
             (xorg-configuration
              (keyboard-layout keyboard-layout)))
            ;; ...
            (service cups-service-type))
      %my-services))
     ```

     Once the `/etc/config.scm` has been set up, the system can be reconfigured:
     ```
     sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm
     ```
     
     The machine does not need to be globally restarted, it is sufficient to restart the service:
     ```
     sudo herd restart guix-daemon
     ```

     The correctness of the set up can then be checked with the ```ps aux | grep
     guix-daemon``` command.


  2. [Authorize](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Substitute-Server-Authorization.html)
     the key used to sign substitutes:

	 ```
	 (public-key
	  (ecc
	   (curve Ed25519)
	   (q #89FBA276A976A8DE2A69774771A92C8C879E0F24614AAAAE23119608707B3F06#)))
	 ```
	 
	 Typically, assuming the key above is stored in `key.txt`, run as root:
	 
	 ```
	 guix archive --authorize < key.txt
	 ```

Enjoy!

## Continuous integration

This channel is [continuously
built](https://guix.bordeaux.inria.fr/jobset/guix-hpc) on our instance
of [Cuirass](https://guix.gnu.org/en/cuirass/), the Guix-based
continuous integration tool.  Each commit on either the `guix-hpc` or
the `guix` channel triggers a rebuild, if needed, of the `guix-hpc`
packages.

## Hacking on Guix-HPC

When working on packages of the `guix-hpc` channel, you'll need to clone
the `guix-hpc` repository:

```
cd src
git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc.git
```

From then on, you can edit package definitions, and then try them out by
passing the location of the checkout using the `-L` flag to `guix build`
and other command-line tools, as in this example:

```
guix build -L ~/src/guix-hpc starpu
```

When you’re satisfied with your changes, push them—your changes are now
just a `guix pull` away for users of your channel!

## More information

The Guix manual contains useful information:

  * on
    [`guix package`](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Invoking-guix-package.html),
    the tool to install, upgrade, and remove packages;
  * on
    [`guix environment`](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Invoking-guix-environment.html),
    the tool that allows you to enter a specific development
    environment;
  * on the [channels
    mechanism](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html),
    which allows you to pull in `guix-hpc` packages in addition to those
    provided by Guix;
  * on
    [the `GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH` environment variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Package-Modules.html#index-GUIX_005fPACKAGE_005fPATH),
    which allows you to extend the set of packages visible to `guix`.

which allows you to create binary bundles that you can transfer and use
on any machine that runs the kernel Linux.
